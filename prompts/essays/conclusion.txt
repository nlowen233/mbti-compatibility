Now that you have written all the essays, please give a summary and conclusion of your findings. Here are some topics of consideration you may or may not lace into your conclusion. Compare and contrast the user's top match with their lowest scoring match and their cognitive stacks. Was there a preference for "thinker" or "feeler" types generally? What about "intuitive" or "sensing" types? "Judging" or "prospecting"? What MBTI types were in the middle-range for compatibility? What are some qualities about them that made them stay in the middle as opposed to rising higher or sinking lower? If the user's shadow type matched highly, make sure to go over the idea of a shadow type and the concept of the shadow stack. If anything stood out about the user's test make sure to mention it in this response. Maybe they had very strong preferences, maybe very weak (you can judge this by looking at the range of their compatibilityScores). Maybe they are a thinker but heavily prefer feelers, what might that say about the user? Look at the user's data and give your most interesting and thought-provoking takes.
