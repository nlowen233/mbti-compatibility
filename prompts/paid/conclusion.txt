Revisit all of your past summarizations and draw an interesting conclusion based on all of them. Compare and contrast the user's top match with their lowest scoring match. Compare and contrast the two matches dominant functions. What MBTI types were in the middle-range for compatibility. What are some qualities about them that made them stay in the middle as opposed to rising higher or sinking lower. If the user's shadow type matched highly, make sure to go over the idea of a shadow type and the concept of the shadow stack. If anything stood out about the user's test make sure to mention it in this response.
