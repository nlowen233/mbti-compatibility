Did the user's expectation of who might be their most compatible type match with the their result? Compare and contrast the type they expected with the type they ended up matching with. What the two types dominant functions? What cognitive functions might be the most similar between the user's expected top match and the user's actual top match? Why might the user have been right or wrong about their preferences. Do they have strong preferences or weaker preferences (judge this based on the disparities between my most compatible and least compatible types)? Is their MBTI type known to have strong or weak preferences? What does their expectation tell you about the kind of people they are usually attracted to? Does their expected top match generally get along well with the user's MBTI type? Are they attracted to the user's type?
